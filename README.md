# Flutter xmpp test project

## Running

### Backend

Start the backend repo. Xmpp server have a web- interface running on port 9090 by default
Configure two users there, named 'mattias' and 'mattias2' (since this is hard coded for now)

### Frontend

Fire up the project file in xcode.
Start one simulator
Debug > Detach from runner
Start another (not the same kind, eg first iPhone 11, and now iPhone 11 Pro) simulator.
Chat away in between the two instances :)
