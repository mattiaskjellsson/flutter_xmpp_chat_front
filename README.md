# Flutter xmpp test project


# Running

## Backend
Start the backend repo. Xmpp server have a web- interface running on port 9090 by default
Configure two users there, named 'mattias' and 'manttias2' (since this is hard coded for now)

## Frontend
Fire up the project file in xcode.
Start one simulator
Debug > Detatch from runner
Start another (not the same kind, eg first iPhone 11, and now iPhone 11 Pro) simulator.
Chat away in between the two instances :)
